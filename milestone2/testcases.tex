\section{Test Cases}

\paragraph{Outline}
Test cases are important and unavoidable part of mobile application development. After generating a matrix for trace ability, testing team would build a set of test cases for the application which would result in either fail or pass. Without implementing test cases, itâ€™s difficult to track, understand, and resolve quality issues of our app.
Scenario testing helps mobile app developers understand the real use of mobile applications, ensuring that the end-to-end functionality of the application under test is working as expected. 
During our time of practice, we have assembled certain best test cases ideas for food ordering app, that, when pursued determinedly, can guarantee a mobile application that is genuinely adaptable.
